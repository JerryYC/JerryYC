Hi there! I'm a master's student studying machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence and its application on solving real-world problems. My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. I'm always eager to learn new things and collaborate with other researchers and engineers.
